QUESTION 7 - Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary. Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: actual-miscalculated  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

>SOLUTION - select ceil(avg(salary)-avg(replace(salary,'0',''))) from employees;

QUESTION 8 - We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as 2 space-separated integers.

>SOLUTION - select max(months*salary), max(count(employee_id)) from employee group by (months*salary); 

QUESTION 9 - Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(sum(lat_n),2), round(sum(long_w),2) from station;

QUESTION 10 - Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(sum(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n>38.7880 and lat_n<137.2345;

QUESTION 11 - Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(max(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n<137.2345;

QUESTION 12 - Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(long_w,4) from station where lat_n=(select max(lat_n) from station where lat_n<137.2345);
 
QUESTION 13 - Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than . Round your answer to  decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(min(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n>38.7780;

QUESTION 14 - Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to 4 decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round(long_w,4) from station where lat_n=(select min(lat_n) from station where lat_n>38.7780);

QUESTION 15 - Consider P1(a,b) and p2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

>SOLUTION - select round((abs(max(lat_n)-min(lat_n))+abs(max(long_w)-min(long_w))),4) from station;

QUESTION 16 - Consider P1(a,c) and P2(b,d) to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 and format your answer to display 4 decimal digits.

>SOLUTION - select round(sqrt(power((min(lat_n)-max(lat_n)),2)+power((min(long_w)-max(long_w)),2)),4) from station;
